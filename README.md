# Mossad CTF

Welcome to the Mossad CTF challenge repository!

## Overview

This repository contains the challenge details for the Mossad CTF. Participants are required to enter the Mossad website, receive a KEY and IV for AES encryption, and then use these to encrypt an image with AES-CBC. The challenge involves multiple stages, combining cryptographic tasks and investigative skills.

## Challenge Details

### Objective
- Enter the Mossad website and obtain a KEY and IV for AES encryption.
- Use the KEY and IV to encrypt a given image with AES-CBC mode.
- Successfully navigate through various stages to find the final solution.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Initial Clue
- **Receive a PDF file** containing a story and clues.
- **Clues**:
  - DNS query to find a domain name.
  - The story mentions a Mossad agent who forgot his password and provides a username.

#### Step 2: DNS Query
- Perform a DNS query on the provided file to extract information.
- **Example**: Search for DNS-related information within the PDF.

#### Step 3: Access the Website
- Use the domain name found in the DNS query to access a website.
- Follow the instructions on the website to proceed to the next stage.

#### Step 4: Obtain Encryption Keys
- **Receive KEY and IV** for AES encryption from the website.
- **Clue**: The website provides an image and instructions to encrypt it using AES-CBC.

#### Step 5: Encrypt the Image
- **Download the image** provided on the website.
- Encrypt the image using the obtained KEY and IV with AES-CBC.
  - **Example command**: Use `openssl` or Python's cryptography library to perform the encryption.

#### Step 6: Analyze Encrypted File
- **Receive an encrypted file** after uploading the image.
- **Clue**: Use tools like hex editors or file type checkers to analyze the file.
  - **Example tool**: [CheckFileType](https://www.checkfiletype.com/).

#### Step 7: Identify the File Type
- Rename the file extension based on the analysis (e.g., to `.jpg`).
- **Clue**: The image contains hidden text.

#### Step 8: Extract Hidden Text
- **Enlarge the image** to find hidden text.
- Use tools to extract text from the image.
  - **Example tool**: [ImageToText](https://www.imagetotext.info/).

#### Step 9: YouTube Clue
- The extracted text provides a **YouTube link and a hint** to check comments.
- **Analyze YouTube comments** to find additional clues.
  - **Example tool**: [YouTube Comment Reader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-comment-reader/jbjbjeceipecokoeocnkcfjpanlipamf).

#### Step 10: Final Clue
- Search YouTube comments for specific keywords (e.g., `mossad`, `ctf`, `Eli Copter`, etc.).
- **Goal**: Find the password hidden by the Mossad agent.

#### Step 11: Login
- Use the obtained **username and password** to log in on the website.
  - **Username**: EliCopter
  - **Password**: MossadRules

#### Step 12: Complete the CTF
- Successfully logging in completes the challenge.
